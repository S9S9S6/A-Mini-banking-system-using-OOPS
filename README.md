#  A-Mini-banking-system-using-OOPS

This is an **interactive banking system** built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.  
It’s a simple, beginner-friendly project that shows how concepts like **classes, inheritance, and encapsulation** can be applied to a real-world problem.  

The main idea behind this program is to help new learners strengthen their understanding of OOP by turning theory into something practical and easy to experiment with.
